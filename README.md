# dualoptE: Code for optimizing Rosetta's energy function using features of small molecules and macromolecules

This repository has a computational pipeline for optimize Rosetta's energy function using the strategy from Park et al., 2016, J. Chem. Theory Comput. 

## Organization of code
* `optimize.dask.py`: a Python script that carries out the pipeline
